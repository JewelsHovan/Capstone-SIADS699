## Visualization Insights

### What the Map Shows

1. **Concentration Patterns**
   - Heavy concentration in specific areas (likely San Jose/Bay Area)
   - Some corridors have multiple work zones
   - Urban vs. suburban distribution visible

2. **Impact Severity Distribution**
   - Most work zones have partial impacts (lanes still open)
   - Full closures are rare (20 out of 1,186)
   - Lane shifts common for ongoing maintenance

3. **Road Network Impact**
   - Same roads appear multiple times (Meridian Ave: 30x)
   - Suggests major corridor improvements
   - Coordinated construction projects
