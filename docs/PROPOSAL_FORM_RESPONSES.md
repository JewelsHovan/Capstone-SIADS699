## Project Subject and Questions (Brief Paragraph)

Highway work zones create significant safety risks, resulting in ~70,000 injuries and 700 fatalities annually in the US. Our project develops a machine learning-powered platform that predicts crash risk in active work zones and provides real-time risk assessments through an interactive geospatial dashboard. We aim to answer: (1) What factors most strongly predict work zone crashes? (2) Can we forecast crash likelihood before they occur? (3) How can we effectively visualize risk for transportation decision-makers? By identifying high-risk work zones in near real-time, our tool enables proactive safety interventions, providing data-driven insights for policy makers to reduce work zone crashes through predictive analytics.

## Datasets

### Work Zone Data

- **Coverage**: California (1,186 zones), Texas (288 zones), New York (1,138 zones)

---

## Usage Restrictions

**Compliant with all restrictions**:
- WZDx, FARS, HPMS, NOAA, OSM: Public domain or open licenses, redistribution allowed
- TIMS: Educational use only, will NOT redistribute raw data in public repo
- Will use aggregated/processed data only in dashboard
- Respect API rate limits with caching
- Include proper attributions

**Mitigation**: No raw TIMS data in GitHub, only aggregated statistics; document all sources and licenses in README.

---

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Interactive Streamlit web dashboard** with:

1. **Predictive ML model** (XGBoost) predicting crash risk (0-1 probability) for work zones using ~30-50 features (work zone characteristics, weather, traffic, temporal, road features)

2. **Geospatial visualization**: Interactive map showing all active work zones color-coded by predicted risk level (Red=High, Orange=Medium, Yellow=Moderate, Green=Low) with clickable popups showing risk score, contributing factors, and recommendations

3. **Real-time predictions**: Integration with Weather.gov API and WZDx feeds for live risk assessments, updating every 10-15 minutes

4. **Analytics dashboard**: Summary statistics (total zones, risk distribution), top risk locations ranked list, temporal patterns, feature importance explanations

5. **Technical documentation**: 15-20 page report covering data sources, methodology, model validation, results, and limitations; plus user guide and code repository

**Success criteria**: Dashboard deploys and runs, model makes predictions (AUC > 0.70), visualizations render correctly, real-time data integratesâ€”deliverable regardless of "exciting" findings.

## Ethical Challenges and Mitigation

**1. Misuse of predictions**: Risk of over-reliance, false security
- **Mitigation**: Clear disclaimers, confidence intervals, emphasize decision-support not decision-making, show model limitations

**2. Privacy concerns**: Crash data contains personal information
- **Mitigation**: Aggregate data only, remove identifiers, spatial/temporal aggregation, follow TIMS educational use terms

**3. Equity and fairness**: Model might reinforce existing disparities
- **Mitigation**: Feature auditing for demographic correlations, fairness metrics, transparency about biases, stakeholder engagement

**4. Liability**: Accountability if predictions are wrong
- **Mitigation**: Research disclaimers, probabilistic framing, version control, human-in-the-loop requirement, no operational guarantees

**5. Unintended consequences**: DOTs might reduce safety at "low-risk" zones
- **Mitigation**: Emphasize minimum standards everywhere, positive framing (where ADDITIONAL measures needed), education that "low risk" is relative

---

## Technical Challenges

**1. Large datasets (>5 GB)**: Crashes (100K+ records), HPMS (500 MB/year), weather archives
- **Mitigation**: Parquet format, PostgreSQL+PostGIS, selective loading, lazy evaluation (dask/vaex), cloud storage if needed

**2. Difficult data cleaning**: Spatial alignment (different coordinate systems), temporal joins (weather at crash time), missing data (35% crashes lack coordinates), inconsistent schemas (WZDx v2.0 vs v4.2)
- **Mitigation**: Standardization pipeline, WGS84 coordinates, buffered spatial joins (100m), nearest-hour temporal joins, imputation/exclusion for missing data, automated validation tests

**3. Complex ML pipeline**: 30-50 features from multiple sources, class imbalance (99% non-crash), model deployment
- **Mitigation**: Modular pipeline (scikit-learn Pipeline), undersampling/class weights for imbalance, MLflow for tracking, FastAPI for serving

**4. Real-time API integration**: Rate limits, latency (<3s response), API failures
- **Mitigation**: Caching (Redis), background updates every 10min, graceful degradation, retry logic, mock mode for development

**5. Geospatial visualization performance**: 1,000+ markers may be slow
- **Mitigation**: MarkerCluster, lazy loading, circle markers not polygons, pre-rendered caching

**6. Model interpretability**: Stakeholders need to understand WHY
- **Mitigation**: SHAP values, feature importance plots, partial dependence, example explanations

**7. Computational resources**: Model training may take hours
- **Mitigation**: Stratified sampling for iteration, efficient algorithms (XGBoost), parallel processing, Google Colab if needed

## Evaluation and Success Criteria

**Model Performance**:

- **Secondary**: Precision-Recall AUC, F1 score, calibration (Brier score), Top-K accuracy
- **Baselines**: Naive (historical crash rate), simple logistic regression, Random Forest
- **Success**: Model outperforms baselines, AUC > 0.70

**Feature Importance**:
- Identify top 10 predictive features
- Verify intuitive sense (weather, traffic, rush hour expected)
- Explain to non-technical stakeholders

**Dashboard Functionality**:
- Loads <5 seconds, renders all zones, clickable markers work, risk colors accurate, real-time data integrates, no crashes in 30-min session, mobile responsive
- 80% of test users identify high-risk zones correctly

**Documentation**:

**Impact** (NOT required for success, but evaluated):
- Identify which factors predict crashes, compare CA/TX/NY, temporal patterns, actionable recommendations

**Overall**: Success = working tool + validated model + clear documentation, NOT "surprising findings"
